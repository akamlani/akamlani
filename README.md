### Hi, I'm Ari ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist, AI Researcher, Speaker, and Leader who is constantly experimenting, and a tinker at heart... 
- ðŸ”­ I joined [Beyond Limits](https://beyond.ai) in 2021 in their AI Solutions Team under the CTO Division.
- âš¡ I'm always listening to Podcasts as I stroll through the city.
- ðŸ˜… Fun fact: I've gone globetrotting around many countries and ended up scaling Mount Everest, a bit past Base Camp...

I'm best reached via [email](mailto:akamlani@gmail.com). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
